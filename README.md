# Zen 7.x-6.x Style Guide

This is the style guide for the Zen 7.x-6.x Drupal theme. Since Zen is a boilerplate theme with no design, its style guide is also a boilerplate style guide. It is designed to be a "starter kit" for building a custom component library.

The style guide is a living style guide generated from the Sass source files. You can view the genrated style guide at: http://johnalbin.github.io/zen-style-guide/styleguide/
